## React Button Component

This is a customizable Nextjs, React button component created as part of a coding challenge. The button has two variants: a dark variant and a green variant, with an outlined option for both. It is built with TypeScript and follows modern coding practices, ensuring readability, performance, and accessibility.

## Features
```bash
Variants:
  Dark
  Green
Outlined Option:
  Solid (default)
  Outlined
Accessibility: Proper aria attributes for better accessibility.
Performance: Optimized to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Unit Tests: The component is tested with unit tests to ensure it functions correctly.
Documented Code: Clear comments are provided throughout the code to explain the logic.
```

## Setup

```bash
// Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chanakaHetti/button-component-project.git

// Install dependencies
npm install

// Run the application
npm run dev

// Run the Storybook

## Notes

-   The Button component is placed inside the components folder with the file name Button.tsx.
-   The Storybook configuration is located in the stories folder, allowing easy access to visual documentation of the button component.
-   Unit tests are written and stored in the __tests__ folder at the root level, ensuring proper testing and validation of the component's behavior.
